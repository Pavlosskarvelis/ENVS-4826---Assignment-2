## Introduction
This paper is intended as a summary and analysis of the article *Ageing Research Reviews* by Mark, et al., 2016. Discussed below will be the methodology of how research was conducted, along with any findings that were prevalent in the research discussed. Through the following summary, I hope to encourage many of my peers to experiment with intermittent fasting on an annually or bi-annually basis.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
